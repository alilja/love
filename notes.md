high speed action game with limited vision/perception

time briefly slows down when you kill an enemy, allowing you to chain kills (maybe a huge color pallete swap when you're in slowdown mode)

attack combos (not kill chains) with different movement patterns and damage; more complicated combos do more damage and have more advantageous movement patterns/speeds

every level should provide some downtime between rooms

rooms should be highly tactical — you enter a room and have to quickly decide what the best course of action is

skill tree: combos, speed/timeslow, perception
	- combos: access to more complicated combos that leads to better movement and more damage
	- speed/timeslow: faster movement speed including in combos, longer timeslowdown after kill
	- perception: allows you to track enemies even when you can't see them

respecing should be a frequent and easy thing to do, based on the needs of the situation

procedural levels? rhythm-based?

the gravity is high — it's hard to navigate in the air, but movement abilities are faster and stronger there
